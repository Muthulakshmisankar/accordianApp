# Accordion JavaScript Project

This project demonstrates an accordion component built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The accordion allows you to expand and collapse sections to show or hide content.

## Execution Method

To view this project locally in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Live Server Extension

Make sure you have the "Live Server" extension installed in Visual Studio Code. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so by following these steps:

- Open Visual Studio Code.
- Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
- Search for "Live Server" in the Extensions Marketplace.
- Click "Install" to install the extension.

### 2. Open the Project in Visual Studio Code

Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.

### 3. Launch Live Server

- Navigate to the `index.html` file in your project.
- Right-click anywhere in the HTML file editor or use the shortcut `Alt+L Alt+O` (Windows) or `Option+L Option+O` (Mac) to open it with Live Server.
- Click on "Go Live" from the bottom right corner of the status bar.

This will launch the project in your default browser using Live Server, allowing you to interact with the accordion component.

## Accordion Functionality

The accordion is designed to toggle the display of content sections when clicked. Each section can be expanded or collapsed individually.

## Project Structure

The project folder is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: Contains the main HTML structure for the accordion and integrates the necessary JavaScript and CSS files.
- `css/`: Folder containing styles for the project.
  - `styles.css`: CSS file responsible for styling the accordion and its components.
- `js/`: Folder containing JavaScript files for the project.
  - `main.js`: Main JavaScript file that initializes the functionality and interacts with the HTML elements.
  - `modules/`: Subfolder containing modularized JavaScript files.
    - `sidepanel.js`: JavaScript file handling side panel functionality.
    - `accordion.js`: JavaScript file managing the accordion functionality.

### File Descriptions

#### `index.html`

This file serves as the entry point to the project and contains the main structure of the accordion component along with links to necessary CSS and JavaScript files.

#### `css/styles.css`

The `styles.css` file in the `css/` folder is responsible for defining the styles and layouts of the accordion, its sections, and any associated elements.

#### `js/main.js`

The `main.js` file in the `js/` folder is the primary JavaScript file responsible for initializing the accordion functionality and handling interactions with the HTML elements. It interacts with the modules for specific functionalities.

#### `js/modules/sidepanel.js`

The `sidepanel.js` file in the `js/modules/` folder contains JavaScript code specifically related to the side panel functionality, if applicable in your project.

#### `js/modules/accordion.js`

The `accordion.js` file in the `js/modules/` folder manages the functionality of the accordion component. It handles the expanding and collapsing of sections and any related logic specific to the accordion.

The modular structure of the JavaScript files allows for a more organized and maintainable codebase, separating different functionalities into distinct modules for easier development and debugging.
